# Cyber-Threat-Hunt

🛡️ Cyber Threat Hunt Report
Reconstruction of Suspicious “Support Session” Activity on gab-intern-vm

Analyst: Drew Howard
Host: gab-intern-vm
Account: g4bri3lintern

Flag-by-Flag Findings

🚩 Flag 1 – Initial Execution Detection

Summary: Identify the earliest suspicious execution originating from Downloads.

Query Purpose:
Find the first PowerShell execution of a suspicious tool launched from the Downloads folder.

Why This Query Is Best:
DeviceProcessEvents shows command-line parameters and time ordering needed to locate the earliest anomalous execution.
```kql
DeviceProcessEvents
| where TimeGenerated between (datetime(2025-10-1) .. datetime(2025-10-15))
| where DeviceName == "gab-intern-vm"
| where FolderPath has "Downloads" or ProcessCommandLine has  "Downloads"
